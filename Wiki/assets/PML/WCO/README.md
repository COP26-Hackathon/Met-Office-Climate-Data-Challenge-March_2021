This work was funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council through its National Capability Long-term Single Centre Science Programme, Climate Linked Atlantic Sector Science, grant number NE/R015953/1, and is a contribution to the Western Channel Observatory.

Data files created and owned by Helen Findlay (hefi@pml.ac.uk). Permission to use these data in scientific publications must be sought from the data originator, and data should not be disseminated further than this Hackathon without the express permission of the originator.

THE DATA POLICY of the NERC National Capability funded Western Channel Observatory is to make the data freely available at the point of delivery. However, we request that prospective data users first contact the points of contact at PML (see data links below) before obtaining the data. They will provide the metadata, the most up to date versions of the data (where available) and most importantly local expertise in how the data can be used. We expect that co-authorship will be offered to relevant PML experts in response to their active collaboration in projects using these data. Any publication or report using these data should acknowledge them as being provided by the Western Channel Observatory.
