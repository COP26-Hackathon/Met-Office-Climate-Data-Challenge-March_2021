Peopleâ€™s experience of climate and environmental change is bound in time and space i.e. local over relatively short time periods.
In contrast, projections of climate and environmental change are global and over decadal or centennial time periods.
Observations, which are critical for forming our understanding, prediction and verification of climate and environmental change are themselves bound in time and / or space.
Challenge: How can we use data to visualise and bridge this gap? Specifically for Ocean CO2 and pH?

File formats used csv and netCDF
